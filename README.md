Autonomous HTML Code Generator
Project Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent agent capable of autonomously generating HTML code snippets based on user-provided specifications. Leveraging the advanced language capabilities of the Claude API via LangChain, the agent understands natural language instructions and converts them into functional HTML structures.

Features
Natural Language Understanding: The agent comprehends user instructions written in plain English.
HTML Code Generation: It translates the understood instructions into accurate and syntactically correct HTML code.
Interactive Input: Users describe the desired HTML layout or elements using natural language.
Contextual Understanding: Maintains context to generate complex and nested HTML structures correctly.
Real-Time Feedback: Immediate generation and display of HTML code based on user inputs.
Code Customization: Allows specification of additional attributes and styles for tailored HTML generation.

Technologies Used
LangChain: Framework for building language model applications.
Claude API: For natural language processing and understanding.
